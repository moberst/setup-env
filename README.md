# Purpose of this repository

This repo exists to help me set up various environments on remote machines (e.g., download and setup python, tensorflow, etc).

Points of interest include:
* `bash/` for setting up command line environment, including tmux
* `git/` for configuring git (see also `hub/` for github specific options)
* `nvim/` for configuring my default local text editor (neovim)
* `python/` for setting up conda and other python stuff
* `tex/` for defining custom LaTeX packages and templates
